IPython README
==============

Overview
========

Welcome to IPython. Our full documentation can be found in the ``docs/dist``
subdirectory in ``.html`` and ``.pdf`` formats, also available online at our
`website <http://ipython.scipy.org>`_.  The ``docs/source`` directory contains
the plaintext version of these manuals.


Dependencies and supported Python versions
==========================================

For full details, see the installation section of the manual.  The basic parts
of IPython only need the Python standard library, but much of its more advanced
functionality requires extra packages.

Officially, IPython requires Python version 2.6 or 2.7.  An experimental port
of IPython to Python 3.x has been sarted, and is available at
http://github.com/takowl/ipython/tree/ipython-py3k.

    
Instant running
===============

You can run IPython from this directory without even installing it system-wide
by typing at the terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   python ipython.py
